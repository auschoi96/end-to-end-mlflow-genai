# Align Judges to Coaching Expertise

Generic LLM judges evaluate outputs based on universal criteria, but they miss the domain-specific nuance that experts understand intuitively. A judge might score an analysis highly because it "sounds good," while a coach knows it's using the wrong data scope or missing key strategic implications.

## Why Judge Alignment Matters

**The Problem**: Without alignment, judges are unreliable proxies for expert judgment
- Generic judges can't distinguish between "3rd down tendencies" vs "3rd and long red zone tendencies"
- They miss when responses use all-field data to answer scoped questions
- They don't understand multi-part question structures coaches use
- They award perfect scores for responses that coaches would rate as incomplete

**The Solution**: Judge alignment automatically calibrates judges to match expert preferences
- Uses labeled dataset from SME review sessions (previous step)
- Optimizer analyzes disagreements between human labels and judge scores
- Refines judge instructions to encode domain-specific expertise
- Result: Scalable quality assessment that reflects coaching judgment

## Two Approaches to Judge Alignment

MLflow provides two optimization algorithms that transform your baseline judges into expert-calibrated evaluators. Both use your labeled data but take different approaches to learning:

### SIMBA (Stochastic Introspective Mini-Batch Ascent)
**How it works:** Iterative refinement through failure analysis
- Identifies traces where judge disagrees with coach
- Uses reflection LLM to analyze *why* the disagreement occurred
- Proposes specific edits to judge instructions
- Repeats across multiple iterations until alignment improves

**Think of it as:** A writing tutor who reviews your mistakes, explains what went wrong, and suggests specific revisions to your instructions

**Best for:** MLflow 3.8 and below, or when you want the proven DSPy-based approach

### MemAlign (Dual-Memory Framework) - Recommended
**How it works:** Fast learning through dual memory systems
- **Semantic Memory**: Extracts general principles from labeled data ("sequence questions need ordered steps")
- **Episodic Memory**: Stores specific examples as reference cases
- Combines both to guide judge decisions on new traces

**Think of it as:** A coach who learns general rules (semantic) but also remembers specific game situations (episodic) to make better calls

**Best for:** MLflow 3.9+, small datasets (2-10 examples), cost/speed-sensitive applications. Up to 100x faster and 10x cheaper than SIMBA.

Both optimizers take the same input (labeled traces) and produce aligned judges that better match expert judgment.

const originalInstructions = `Evaluate if the response in {{ outputs }} appropriately analyzes the available data and provides an actionable recommendation the question in {{ inputs }}. The response should be accurate, contextually relevant, and give a strategic advantage to the  person making the request. Your grading criteria should be:  1: Completely unacceptable. Incorrect data interpretation or no recommendations 2: Mostly unacceptable. Irrelevant or spurious feedback or weak recommendations provided with minimal strategic advantage 3: Somewhat acceptable. Relevant feedback provided with some strategic advantage 4: Mostly acceptable. Relevant feedback provided with strong strategic advantage 5 Completely acceptable. Relevant feedback provided with excellent strategic advantage`;

const alignedInstructions = `Evaluate if the response in {{ outputs }} appropriately analyzes the available data and provides an actionable recommendation the question in {{ inputs }}. The response should be accurate, contextually relevant, and give a strategic advantage to the  person making the request. Your grading criteria should be:  1: Completely unacceptable. Incorrect data interpretation or no recommendations 2: Mostly unacceptable. Irrelevant or spurious feedback or weak recommendations provided with minimal strategic advantage 3: Somewhat acceptable. Relevant feedback provided with some strategic advantage 4: Mostly acceptable. Relevant feedback provided with strong strategic advantage 5 Completely acceptable. Relevant feedback provided with excellent strategic advantage

If the input question asks for a **"typical play sequence"** (keywords: "sequence", "play-by-play", "what do they call first/next", "script", "with under X minutes"), then you should **check that the output contains an explicit ordered series of actions** (e.g., Step 1/2/3; "1st play: … 2nd play: …"; or a plausible sample drive with down/distance/clock). If the output is mostly **tendencies, rates, formations, or defensive tips** without an ordered progression, you should cap the rating around **3 (somewhat acceptable)** even if the football analysis is otherwise strong.

If the output includes numbers/statistics (pass rate, EPA, air yards) but does not explain **how those translate into an actual sequence** (e.g., "open with quick game to boundary, then spike/check, then shot play"), treat it as **partial credit**: relevant but not answering the "sequence" framing.

When grading, explicitly map the user's ask to required elements:
- For "typical sequence": require (a) ordering, (b) situational context (clock/TOs/field position or down & distance), and (c) representative play types/concepts in that order.
- If missing (a), do not award 4–5.
- Reserve 5 only when the response both answers the sequence request and provides actionable recommendations aligned to that sequence.

If the input question is NOT asking for a "typical play sequence" (i.e., it asks "How do they use X vs Y?", "what concepts/tendencies?", "how do they attack coverage?"), then you should NOT penalize primarily for missing an ordered step-by-step sequence; instead grade on whether the output provides (a) concrete schematic explanation (formations/personnel, route concepts, protection/action, intended leverage vs man), (b) actionable coaching takeaways/counters, and (c) at least a few specific examples (even if qualitative) such as common concept families (e.g., boot/flood, crossers, dagger, glance/RPO-like looks) and who they target.

If the output is only clarifying questions or meta-discussion with zero analysis/recommendations, then assign a 1 and explicitly say: it failed to answer the question at all; clarifications can be asked but must come after giving an initial best-effort analysis.

If the output gives some correct high-level ideas but is vague (no concrete concepts/usage details, no actionable adjustments), cap at 2–3. Reserve 4–5 for responses that translate play-action vs man into coach-usable guidance (what the offense is trying to create vs man, what defenders should key, what coverages/techniques to call, and situational tendencies).

Always format \`result\` as an integer (1–5) matching the module schema; do not include extra text like "1: Completely unacceptable…" inside the numeric field.`;

                Learned to distinguish "typical play sequence" requests from "tendency" questions. Requires ordered progression (Step 1/2/3) for sequence questions, but doesn't penalize missing sequences when analyzing tendencies.

                Learned to check if responses match requested scope (e.g., "red zone only", "3rd down", "after turnovers"). Caps score at 3-4 when response uses all-field data for scoped questions.
